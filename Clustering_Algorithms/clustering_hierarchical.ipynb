    "**Hierarchical clustering** determines cluster assignments by building a hierarchy. This is implemented by either a bottom-up or a top-down approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agglomerative clustering** is the bottom-up approach. It merges the two points that are the most similar until all points have been merged into a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divisive clustering** is the top-down approach. It starts with all points as one cluster and splits the least similar clusters at each step until only single data points remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods produce a tree-based hierarchy of points called a **dendrogram**. Similar to partitional clustering, in hierarchical clustering the number of clusters (k) is often predetermined by the user. Clusters are assigned by cutting the dendrogram at a specified depth that results in k groups of smaller dendrograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many partitional clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering is a **deterministic** process, meaning cluster assignments won’t change when you run an algorithm twice on the same input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **strengths** of hierarchical clustering methods include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They often reveal the finer details about the relationships between data objects.\n",
    "- They provide an interpretable dendrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **weaknesses** of hierarchical clustering methods include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They’re computationally expensive with respect to algorithm complexity.\n",
    "- They’re sensitive to noise and outliers."
